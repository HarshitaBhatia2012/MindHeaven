  Campus Connect is a smart platform designed to digitize campus life by centralizing clubs, projects, events, and faculty-led opportunities in one place. It solves
  the problem of scattered recruitment and lack of visibility by offering structured student profiles, dynamic dashboards, and personalized AI-powered recommendations.
  Students can explore clubs, apply through stepper-based forms, and receive matches based on their skills and interests. Clubs benefit from streamlined recruitment,
  dedicated update pages, and improved communication. The platform aims to enhance participation, reduce mismatches, and strengthen campus engagement through clean
  UI/UX, dynamic data handling, and personalized discovery. Campus Connect acts as a bridge between students and opportunities, creating a more collaborative and
  growth-oriented campus ecosystem.
